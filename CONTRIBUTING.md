# Contributing to props

Thanks for your interest in contributing to `props`! 


# Developer set-up


## Prerequisites and Tools 

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (usually provided by the OS)
- [Jabba](https://github.com/shyiko/jabba) for Java SDK management
- [Bazel](https://bazel.build/) (we prefer [Bazelisk](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk))

You can run `make setup` to install *Jabba* and *Bazelisk*.  This target also sets up git hooks,
which runs formatters and static code analysis tools.

Also, you will need a text editor or IDE; we use [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).


## Get the code

- Fork the [repository](https://github.com/MihaiBojin/props)
- Clone your forked repository locally (`git clone https://github.com/[USERNAME]/props`)
- Add this repo as an upstream: `git remote add upstream https://github.com/MihaiBojin/props`


## IntelliJ config

The [Bazel IntelliJ plugin](https://ij.bazel.build) unfortunately doesn't work very well with
[JPMS modules](https://github.com/bazelbuild/intellij/issues/1992).
Until this issue is resolved, the JPMS `module-info.java` module descriptors will be generated
at build time, during the `make assemble-maven` target.


## Building and testing

Before doing anything else, run `jabba use` in the project's root directory.
This will ensure you are running the version of the JDK used (and tested) for this project.

You can build the project with: `make build`.

And you can run the tests with `make test`.

We use the [Google JAVA Formatter](https://github.com/google/google-java-format) to keep the code 
consistent.  You can run `make fmtcheck` to verify that all code is properly formatted.  
This target runs in the pre-commit git hook which is automatically installed when you run 
`make setup` or can be individually installed with `make git-hooks`. 

All Bazel build files are formatted with [buildifier](https://github.com/bazelbuild/buildtools/buildifier).


# Contributing

- Please [create a GitHub issue](https://github.com/MihaiBojin/props/issues/new)
- Then open a Pull Request and tag the newly created issue (e.g., `Fixes #12345`)
- For PRs to be accepted, you must agree to the terms of the [CLA](CLA.md) and to 
  contribute the code under the project's [license](./LICENSE).

To sign the [Contributor License Agreement](./CLA.md) please follow the 
[steps outlined here](./contributors/README.md). 

**Reviewers will ensure that all requirements are met before merging PRs.**


# Releasing

The release process is automated using [GitHub Actions](/.github/workflows/deploy-maven-central.yml).

To stage a release:

A. If you are a collaborator to the [props repo](https://github.com/MihaiBojin/props/):
- create a [lightweight tag](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging#_lightweight_tags)
  `git tag vx.y.z`
- and ask [me](https://github.com/MihaiBojin) to release it to Maven Central 
  via [Sonatype](https://oss.sonatype.org/#stagingRepositories)

B. Otherwise, [create a new issue](https://github.com/MihaiBojin/props/issues/new) and specify the
git commit hash you would like to release and a version number.

We follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) so please bear that in mind when you propose
a new MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH release version:
- MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
- MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and
- PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.
