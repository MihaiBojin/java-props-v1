# props

This project aims to provide a library which manages properties and secrets coming from
multiple sources (startup properties, environment, property files, etc.)

While `props` is currently implemented in JAVA, additional languages are planned in the future.

# Features

- Simple and straightforward API
- Optimized for reads, property values are cached and updated when changed
- No third-party dependencies in the core module
- Periodically refresh properties from sources
- Thread-safety
- Ability to specify the order in which sources are queried for values


# Performance

While `props` is quite fast, it was not built for low-latency applications.
You can read more about this topic on the [benchmark results page](java/benchmark/README.md).
